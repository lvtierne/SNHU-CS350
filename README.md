### Milestone Three Artifact

**Artifact Overview:**

In Milestone Three, I developed a project using the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL to implement a Morse code message display via LEDs. This involved creating a synchronous state machine to manage LED blinking patterns, integrating timer and interrupt functionalities, and using TI Code Composer Studio (CCS) for development and debugging.

**Project Goals:**

- Design a state machine to control LED blinking in Morse code.
- Implement timer-based state machine management.
- Use interrupts to detect button presses and change the Morse code message.
- Develop and submit a state machine diagram created with draw.io.

**Files Submitted:**

1. **Zipped Workspace:** Contains all project files and source code.
2. **Video Demonstration:** A 1-minute video showing the LEDs blinking Morse code and demonstrating button functionality.
3. **Lab Questions Document:** Answers to the questions from the Milestone Three Timer Interrupt Lab Guide.
4. **State Machine Diagram:** PDF of the state machine diagram created with draw.io.

**Project Reflection:**

1. **Summary of the Project:**
   - The goal was to create a system on the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL that uses LEDs to display Morse code and changes the pattern based on button presses. The project involved using CCS for coding, compiling, and debugging.

2. **What Went Well:**
   - The state machine was successfully implemented, and the LEDs accurately displayed Morse code patterns.
   - Timer and interrupt functionalities were effectively integrated.
   - Comprehensive state machine documentation was created.

3. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - Enhanced error handling for timer and interrupt code.
   - Expanded documentation with more detailed state transition explanations.

4. **Tools and Resources Added:**
   - Gained hands-on experience with CCS and hardware debugging.
   - Used draw.io for creating technical diagrams.

5. **Transferable Skills:**
   - Skills in state machine design, interrupt handling, and hardware interfacing are applicable to other embedded systems projects.
   - Experience with CCS and embedded hardware will benefit future coursework and projects.

6. **Maintainability and Adaptability:**
   - The code is modular, well-commented, and adaptable for different messages or hardware setups.
   - Documentation and code structure follow best practices for maintainability and readability.
