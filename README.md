## 1.8 RIMS implicitly defined I/O variables: Participation Activities
### 1.8.1: RIMS B outputs and A inputs.
Write a C program in RIMS that repeatedly executes: B = 7. Note that outputs B2, B1, and B0 become 1s, because 7 is 00000111 in binary (note that 7 appears under the output pins in RIMS). Next, set the input switches such that A3=1, A2=0, A1=0, and A0=1, with the other inputs 0, and note that 9 appears below RIMS' input pins (because 00001001 is 9 in binary).
